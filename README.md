# Learn more about outer space!

This app uses two NASA APIs to pull information about Natural Events observed from space, and meteorites
that were in the earths orbit, during the week of 2022-12-01 to 2022-12-08! 

These dates do not have any special significance, apart from there were a good number of natural events and 
meteorites in that week! So the full functionality of the app could be used in this case. 

Make sure to click through each Natural Event to see where on Earth it occured. 

And click through each meteorite to view additional info about it!
