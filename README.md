# Learn more about outer space!

This app uses two NASA APIs to pull information about Natural Events observed from space, and asteroids
that were in the earths orbit, during the week of 2022-12-01 to 2022-12-08! 

To use it, clone the repo to your local machine and cd into the "space" folder and run npm install in your terminal. Then run `npm start' to launch the website. Note that it will only launch with Node.js v16. 

These dates do not have any special significance, apart from there were a good number of natural events and 
asteroids in that week! So the full functionality of the app could be used in this case. 

Click on the menu on the top right and use the buttons to toggle either of the following graphics -

- Natural Events that were observed on Earth from space in the last week Dec 1 - 8th
     - click on each event to see a map of its location
- Asteroids orbiting earth in the week Dec 1 - 8th (you will have to scroll down to see this if you
already clicked on Natural events)
    - click on each asteroid to view information on its size

## Pending fixes 

Clicking on just Asteroids, results in info being received with a lag.
